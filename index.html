        <ul id="tribute-info">
          <li>1862 - Ekvtime Takaishvili was born in the village of Likhauri in the western Georgian province of Guria</li>
          <li>1887 - he graduated from St. Petersburg University</li>
          <li>From 1887 to 1917 - he lectured on the history of Georgia at various prestigious schools in Tbilisi, including the Tbilisi Gymnasium for Nobility</li>
          <li>from 1907 to 1921 - the Society of History and Ethnography of Georgia</li>
          <li>Between 1907 and 1910 - he organized a series of archaeological expeditions to the historic Georgian region of Tao-Klarjeti</li>
          <li>1917 - taking part in the establishment of the National Democratic Party of Georgia</li>
          <li>from 1919 to 1921 - being elected to a post of Deputy Chairman in the Constituent Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Georgia</li>
          <li>1917 - he was among the founders and professors of the Tbilisi State University (TSU). He followed the Georgian government in their French exile, taking the Georgian national treasury – numerous precious pieces of Georgian material culture - with him to Europe.</li>
          <li>In the early 1930s - Takaishvili won a lawsuit against Salome Obolenskaya, daughter of the last Mingrelian prince Niko Dadiani, </li>
          <li>1935 - Takaishvili urged the French government to hand the collections to Georgia, but it was not until the end of the World War II when he was able.</li>
          <li>1944 - to attract the attention of the Soviet ambassador Aleksandr Bogomolov to the fate of the Georgian treasury. Joseph Stalin's good relations with General Charles de Gaulle enabled Takaishvili to bring the treasury back to Georgia. However, Takaishvili had to spend his long days in Tbilisi under house arrest, seemingly considered to be too old to be imprisoned.</li>
          <li>1953 - He died.</li>
          <li>2013 - he was posthumously awarded the title and Order of National Hero of Georgia.</li>
        </ul>  
        <p class="last">Takaishvili never sold a single piece of the priceless collection to live on. Konstantine Gamsakhurdia called him " საქართველოს მეჭურჭლეთუხუცესი".</p>
